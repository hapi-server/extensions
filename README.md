# extensions
Area for describing extensions implemented by some servers and clients.

The HAPI server has always supported extensions which can be safely ignored.  For example, in 
a server response x_about might be a URL which tells more about a data set.

Here we try to describe first how one documents an extension, so that clients or servers might use
it, and second, descriptions of extensions themselves.

See tickets for discussions of new extentions.  Mature extensions should be described using documents linked to from here.

# Example extensions
## Availability
How does one know when data can be requested?

## Data Reduction
This allows one to request reduced versions of the data.
