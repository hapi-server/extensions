# extensions
Area for describing extensions implemented by some servers and clients.

The HAPI server has always supported extensions which can be safely ignored.  For example, in 
a server response x_about might be a URL which tells more about a data set.

Here we try to describe first how one documents an extension, so that clients or servers might use
it, and second, descriptions of extensions themselves.

# Example extensions
## Availability
How does one know when data can be requested?

## Data Reduction
This allows one to request reduced versions of the data.
